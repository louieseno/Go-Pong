# G⚬ P⚬ng 
A two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis using Flutter. 

## Description
Go Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. This game features two bricks and a ball. Each brick represents the players who will be playing against each other.  A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball.

The first player who reaches the goal score -- by default 5 points, wins the game!

I started the project after watching the interview of **Flutter Flame Engine** creators in a youtube video *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ZZyzKS-rg*.
But instead of diving into Flutter Flame Engine, I want to try first how to create a game using only Flutter.
